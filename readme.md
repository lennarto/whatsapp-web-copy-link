## 🚀 Installation 
todo

## 🔥 Usage 

If a whatsapp number is "+491759928165", then the following urls will be copied:
- 📱 App: https://wa.me/491759928165
- 💻 Web: https://web.whatsapp.com/send?phone=491759928165

Because sometines you don't know what you will need / use in the feature - therefore I added a button "🔗 Both" so you can save both urls in your notes app.
- 🔗 Both urls will create a text: 
     "https://wa.me/491759928165 / https://web.whatsapp.com/send?phone=491759928165"
