## 🚀 Installation 

<a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/whatsapp-web-copy-url/aclcelbdcmiklepkkgccaldkmehkmjdn">
  <img src="images/chrome_web_store.png" alt="Install from Chrome Web Store" width="210"/>
</a>

- Option 1: Install directly from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/whatsapp-web-copy-url/aclcelbdcmiklepkkgccaldkmehkmjdn)
- Option 2: Download this repository and load it as an unpacked extension in Chrome.

## 🔥 Usage 

This addon will create 3 buttons in the whatsapp web app.

If a whatsapp number is "+491759928165", then the following urls will be copied:
- 📱 App: https://wa.me/491759928165 
- 💻 Web: https://web.whatsapp.com/send?phone=491759928165

Because sometines you don't know what you will need / use in the feature - therefore I added a button "🔗 Both" so you can save both urls in your notes app.
- 🔗 Both urls will create a text: 
     "https://wa.me/491759928165 / https://web.whatsapp.com/send?phone=491759928165"

*(Both App and Web work on iOS and Macbook. Not tested on Windows or Android yet).*
